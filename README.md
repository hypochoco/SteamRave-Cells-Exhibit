# SteamRave-Cells-Exhibit

Projection art with the v1 Kinect Sensor (Xbox 1414)

## Notes

- Daniel and I are using Windows. We're not sure how everything else works on Mac, so you may have to figure that out.

## Installing Kinect Software (Windows)

To use the Kinect sensor, install the following from Microsoft.

- [Kinect for Windows Developer Toolkit v1.8](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=40276)
- [Kinect for Windows SDK 1.8](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=40278)
<!---- [Kinect for Windows Runtime 2.0](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=44559) ~-->


## Using Processing

NOTE: Processing 4.0 beta 6 is sus! Windows detects security issues with it, so we are just sticking with 3.5.4 for now.

[Install Processing 3.5.4](https://processing.org/download)

Unzip the download into a folder you want to work in. In the folder, open the processing application.

## Installing Necessary Libraries in Processing

Open the processing application and go to the top where it says "Sketch". Next, go to "Import Library" -> "Add Library". In the search bar, search for the following libraries and install them.
